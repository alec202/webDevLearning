The website I intend on designing will be the library database one
==================================================================

# Library Database Management System with a SQL/Cloud database component.
* Tables on:
  - Books
  - Customers Loyalty/Rewards
  - Employee Information
  - Purchases/Receipts table 
* Perform joins to view which employees are rewards members.
* Perform joins based off customer unique ID with purchases/receipts table to view their recent purchases.

# To Do List Website #
* Login screen with cloud component to maintain to do list data.
  - Maintain completed items in cloud
* On item completion add celebration animation

# Weather Website through API with user location tracking
* tracks users location
* Could maintain a database with user's visited locations whether that's cloud based or not
